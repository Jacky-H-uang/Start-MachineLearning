# This is Introduction of the Decision Trees,and the contents are following:

- Introducing decision trees.
- Measuring consistency(一致性) in a dataset.
- Using recursion to construct a decision tree.
- Plotting trees in Matplotlib.



## Steps of the Implementing the Decision Trees:

### 1. Prerequisite knowledge: Information Theory. (in directary Shannon-entropy)
>Shannon entropy (香农熵):
>
>- Entropy is defined as the expected values of the infotmation.
>
>- The information of xi is defined as : l(xi) = log2P(xi)
>
>- You need to calculate all the expected value of all the information of all posible values of our class.
>
>- the Python codes to calculate is in file "Shannon-entropy"


### 2. Building the Trees.     (in directary Tree-Building)
> Using Recursion to Creating the Decision Trees

### 3. Visualize the Decision Trees.    (in directary Plotting-Trees)
> Using the Matplotlib of Python to plotting the Trees.
