# Summary Of Learning kNN

        kNN is a simple algorithm to classify data.The algorithm has to carry around the full dataset;
    For large datasets , this implies a large amount of storeage.
        The drawback of is that kNN doesn't give you any idea of the underlying structure of the data.
    And the One modificaton to kNN called kD-trees allows you to reduce the number of the calcuations and improve the kNN.
